Broadly, I make my living with software and data.  I've done it under various guises (predictive analytics / data science / software engineering) for various products (document image straighteners / medical bill correcters / e-commerce product recommenders / map search engines) in various cities (San Diego, Santa Monica, Shenzhen, Singapore).   While I'm at it I try my best to understand the businesses I support and the people I meet.

This site is a starting point for me to "show my work" as advocated by [Austin Kleon][show-your-work].

You can find details of my work history on my [résumé][github-resume].
