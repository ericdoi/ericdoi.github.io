In the past 10 years, I've gotten to work on software which straightens document images, corrects billing errors, 
recommends eCommerce products, and searches for locations in maps.
This site is a starting point for me to "show my work" as advocated by [Austin Kleon][show-your-work].

You can find details of my work on my [résumé][github-resume].
